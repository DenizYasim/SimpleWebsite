              <p>&emsp;The Earth is the only planet man can ever call home. Therefore, he must love and take care of it. This is the place where plants and animals thrive, its atmosphere and its terrain providing what man needs in order to live.
              </p>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>&emsp;When man refuses to acknowledge his responsibility to care for nature, destruction occurs. Devastation happens either by omission or commission. Animals disappear and become endangered or extinct because of irresponsible hunting. Plant life is essentially destroyed by incessant cutting of trees and burning of grasslands. The atmosphere is being damaged by pollution. Global warming destroys land masses as the sea rises because of increasing temperatures. It even causes the growth and rapid spread of different kinds of bacteria and viruses. There are people who are directly responsible for the devastation in our surroundings while there are also people who do not even think about it.
                </p>
              <h2></h2>
              <p>&emsp;We will remind people that it is not too late to care for the environment. While the Earth’s ozone layer cannot be made whole again, man can prevent its further ruin by addressing the issues of pollution and global warming. While we cannot bring back animal species that have become extinct, we can still protect endangered ones and make sure that other animals are out of harm’s way. Reforestation is likewise not impossible. Animals and plants also face risks because man destroys their natural habitats and kills them. The changes in nature force certain species of animals to either adapt or die. The bacterial and chemical contamination of water systems as well as oil explorations endangers both animal and plant life. The Earth is a paradise and man should care about it in significant ways – big and small.
              </p>
                <h2></h2>
                <p>&emsp;While man’s purpose is to improve the economy and have ample supply, the machineries and systems that he creates devastate the environment. Eventually, this defeats the purpose of living on the planet. The Earth is made for co-habitation and the pursuit of man’s advancement of technology and biodiversity should not destroy all other things that thrive on it. Nature provides what man needs and man should be responsible to take care of nature. If man wants later generations to enjoy living on the planet, he should be responsible to protect it now.
                </p>
                  <h2></h2>
                  <p>&emsp;It is never too late. While one person may not make a big impact on the environment by himself, the collective simple efforts of many concerned people can help conserve nature. Everyone should do their share.
